Hi! It's Zheng /zɛn/ LUO 罗峥 also going by Tim, as I strive to be a [helpful companion]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link helpful_companion.md %}).

I’m a graduate student advised by Prof. [Remy Wang](https://remy.wang/) at the Computer Science Department of UCLA. I was mentored by Prof. [Ahmet Kara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmet-kara-9a4019126/?originalSubdomain=de) and Prof. [Dan Olteanu](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/dast/people/Olteanu.html) in Zurich. Before that, I had worked as a quantitative analyst on financial derivatives and studied math in Chicago and Wuhan.
