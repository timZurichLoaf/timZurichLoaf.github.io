Hi! It's Zheng /zɛn/ LUO 罗峥 also going by Tim, as I strive to be a <a href='https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2TI.1.7'>helpful companion</a>.

I’m a graduate student advised by Prof. [Remy Wang](https://remy.wang/) at the Computer Science Department of UCLA. I was mentored by Prof. Ahmet Kara and Prof. Dan Olteanu in [Zurich](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/dast.html). Before that, I had worked as a quantitative analyst on financial derivatives and studied math in Chicago and Wuhan.
